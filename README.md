# RFM-Segmentation

RFM segmentation is a great method to identify groups of customers for special treatment. 
  - It can be used to improve customer marketing.
   - It allows marketers to target specific clusters of customers with communications that are much more relevant for their particular behaviour - and thus generate mch higher rate of response, plus oncreased loyalty and customer lifetime value
  
 - ### R Recency, F Frequency and M Monetary.
  
- Recency (R): When was a customer's most recent activity or transaction with the brand or company?

- Frequency (F): How often has a customer transacted or interacted with the brand during a particular period of time?

- Monetary (M): what is the size of the customer's transaction? / How much a customer has spent with the brand during a particular period of time?


We may use this technique to gain a deeper understanding of our user base, allowing us to ask (and, more importantly, answer) the following important questions:
- How many different RFM segments do we have for users? What are the unique high-level characteristics of each segment? (By answering these questions, we can determine business levers that can be used to maximize revenue for each segment)
- What is the percentage of each RFM segment? (Answering this question helps one to size opportunities)
